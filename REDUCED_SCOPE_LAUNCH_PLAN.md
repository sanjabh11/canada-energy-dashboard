## RISK MITIGATION

### üî¥ **HIGH RISK** - Mitigation Strategies

1. **Indigenous Governance Not Finalized**
   - **Risk**: Indigenous dashboard might not meet governance standards
   - **Mitigation**: Add prominent disclaimers, offer opt-out, schedule formal review post-launch
   - **Contingency**: Disable Indigenous features if governance concerns arise

2. **Load Testing Reveals Performance Issues**
   - **Risk**: Platform might not handle expected user load
   - **Mitigation**: Set conservative scaling limits, implement queuing
   - **Contingency**: Phased rollout with capacity throttling

3. **Security Vulnerability Discovered**
   - **Risk**: Critical security flaw found in staging or production
   - **Mitigation**: Regular security scans, immediate patching process
   - **Contingency**: Rollback capability, security incident response plan

### üü° **MEDIUM RISK** - Monitoring Plans

4. **User Confusion About Missing Features**
   - **Risk**: Users expect emissions tracking, market intelligence
   - **Mitigation**: Clear "Coming Soon" badges, feature availability page
   - **Monitoring**: Track support tickets about missing features

5. **Streaming Data Reliability**
   - **Risk**: IESO or other feeds become unstable
   - **Mitigation**: Multi-level fallback, cached data, clear connection status
   - **Monitoring**: Connection health dashboard, automatic alerts
