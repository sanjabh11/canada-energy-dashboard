# Research Plan: hf_electricity_demand Dataset from Hugging Face

## Task Overview
Comprehensive research on the hf_electricity_demand dataset from Hugging Face for electricity demand forecasting data.

## Research Objectives
1. [ ] Specific Hugging Face dataset details and access methods
2. [ ] Dataset structure, schema, and data types
3. [ ] Data volume, geographical coverage, and time range
4. [ ] Hugging Face API access patterns and rate limits
5. [ ] Sample data format and key columns
6. [ ] Optimal streaming parameters for HF datasets
7. [ ] Integration considerations with Hugging Face API
8. [ ] Authentication and access requirements

## Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Investigation
- [x] Search for hf_electricity_demand dataset on Hugging Face
- [x] Find official dataset page and documentation
- [x] Gather basic information about the dataset

**Key Finding**: No specific "hf_electricity_demand" dataset exists. Found relevant datasets:
- EDS-lab/electricity-demand (most comprehensive)
- rajistics/electricity_demand (Victoria, Australia)
- huggingface/electricity-production (demo dataset)

### Phase 2: Technical Deep Dive
- [x] Extract detailed dataset information from official sources
- [x] Research Hugging Face datasets API documentation
- [x] Investigate authentication and access requirements
- [x] Find code examples and usage patterns

### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis
- [x] Research streaming parameters and best practices
- [x] Analyze integration considerations
- [x] Document API rate limits and access patterns
- [x] Compile sample data formats

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Documentation
- [x] Compile all findings into comprehensive report
- [x] Verify all information accuracy
- [x] Create final documentation

## Status: COMPLETE - All research objectives fulfilled
