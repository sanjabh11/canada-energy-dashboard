# UI Layout and Alignment Enhancement for Canadian Energy Information Portal

## Problem Statement
The current Canadian Energy Information Portal has inconsistent layouts, poor alignment, and suboptimal use of screen space across its 11 pages. Content is often compressed, misaligned, or has excessive whitespace, leading to a poor user experience and reduced readability of critical energy data visualizations.

## Objectives
- Improve layout consistency across all 11 pages
- Optimize graph placement and sizing for better data visualization
- Enhance text and explanation positioning for logical flow
- Implement responsive design for better mobile/tablet experience
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Ensure professional, modern appearance aligned with government portal standards

## Scope
- All 11 pages of the Canadian Energy Information Portal
- Layout and alignment improvements only (no new features)
- CSS/styling changes with minimal functional code modifications
- Responsive design implementation

## Success Criteria
- All graphs have appropriate sizing (no compression/stretching)
- Consistent spacing and margins across all pages
- Better use of horizontal space for side-by-side content
- Improved readability of explanatory text
- Mobile/tablet responsive design working correctly
- Accessibility compliance maintained
- Professional appearance suitable for government portal

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Responsive Grid System
- Implement CSS Grid or Flexbox for consistent layouts
- Use 12-column grid system for flexibility
- Define standard breakpoints for desktop/tablet/mobile

### 2. Graph Optimization
- Set maximum widths to prevent compression
- Implement proper aspect ratios for charts
- Add container queries for responsive behavior

### 3. Text and Content Positioning
- Position explanations beside or below graphs logically
- Use cards/panels for related information grouping
- Implement consistent typography hierarchy

### 4. Spacing and Alignment
- Reduce excessive side margins
- Increase padding between elements for cleaner look
- Ensure consistent vertical rhythm

### 5. Navigation and Sidebars
- Implement sidebars for navigation/filters where appropriate
- Maintain centered main content without compression
- Add breadcrumbs and navigation aids

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Architecture
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Create reusable component classes for common layouts
- Implement CSS custom properties for consistent spacing

### Component Structure
- Create layout wrapper components for consistent structure
- Implement responsive container components
- Use grid/flexbox utilities consistently

### Accessibility Considerations
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Add proper ARIA labels where needed
- Test with screen readers

## Testing Strategy
- Visual regression testing for layout changes
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile/tablet responsive testing
- Accessibility testing with automated tools
- User feedback collection for layout preferences

## Risk Mitigation
- Create backup of current styles before changes
- Implement changes incrementally per page
- Test thoroughly before production deployment
- Prepare rollback plan if needed

## Timeline
- Week 1: Audit current layouts, implement grid system
- Week 2: Optimize graphs and text positioning
- Week 3: Add sidebars and responsive enhancements
- Week 4: Testing, accessibility review, and deployment

## Dependencies
- Access to all 11 page components
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Component library (Lucide icons, etc.)
- Testing environment setup
