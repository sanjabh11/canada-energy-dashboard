# Phase 4 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 4 of the Energy Data Dashboard project has been successfully implemented, adding advanced grid optimization and security assessment capabilities. This phase introduces two new dashboard components with real-time monitoring, AI-powered recommendations, and comprehensive analytics.

## Components Implemented

### 1. GridOptimizationDashboard (`src/components/GridOptimizationDashboard.tsx`)

**Features:**
- **Real-time Grid Monitoring**: Live IESO data integration with demand/supply tracking
- **Stability Metrics**: Frequency, voltage, and congestion monitoring with visual indicators
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: LLM-generated optimization suggestions with confidence scores
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates for grid status changes
- **Interactive Charts**: Demand/supply trends, stability metrics, and recommendation priority analysis

**Key Metrics Displayed:**
- Reserve Margin (%)
- Frequency Stability (Hz)
- Active Alerts Count
- Data Source Status (IESO/Mock)

**AI Integration:**
- Grid optimization recommendations via `/api/llm/grid-optimization` endpoint
- Real-time analysis of grid conditions
- Priority-based action items with implementation timelines

### 2. SecurityDashboard (`src/components/SecurityDashboard.tsx`)

**Features:**
- **Threat Risk Matrix**: Interactive scatter plot showing likelihood vs impact
- **Incident Monitoring**: Real-time security incident tracking with status updates
- **Threat Modeling**: Comprehensive threat assessment with risk scoring
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Implementation status tracking and effectiveness analysis
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regulatory compliance scoring and alerts

**Key Metrics Displayed:**
- Overall Risk Score (0-100)
- Active Incidents Count
- Compliance Score (%)
- Threat Detection Rate (%)

**Security Frameworks:**
- Threat categorization (cyber, physical, supply chain, geopolitical, natural disaster)
- Risk scoring based on likelihood × impact
- Mitigation strategy prioritization
- Incident response time tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **React Components**: Built using TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions
- **State Management**: Local state with useEffect hooks for data fetching
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data streaming
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and fallback mechanisms
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS with mobile-first approach

### Data Integration
- **IESO API**: Real-time electricity demand and price data
- **WebSocket Streams**: Live updates for grid and security events
- **LLM Integration**: AI-powered analysis and recommendations
- **Mock Data Fallback**: Graceful degradation when APIs unavailable

### API Endpoints Added
```typescript
// Grid Optimization
GET /api/llm/grid-optimization
GET /api/grid/status
GET /api/grid/stability-metrics

// Security Assessment
GET /api/security/threat-models
GET /api/security/incidents
GET /api/security/metrics
GET /api/security/mitigation-strategies
```
