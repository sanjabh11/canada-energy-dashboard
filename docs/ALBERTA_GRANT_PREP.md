## One-Page Pitch Summary

### Product
**Canada Energy Intelligence Platform** - Real-time energy analytics dashboard for Alberta professionals, utilities, and municipalities.

- **Real-time AESO integration** (Alberta pool prices, interconnection queue)
- **Indigenous data sovereignty** (OCAP® and FPIC compliance)
- **Carbon and ESG tracking** (provincial emissions, green bonds)

### Market
- **TAM**: ~$500M (North American utility analytics)
- **SAM**: ~$50M (Canadian energy analytics)
- **SOM**: ~$2M (Alberta-focused customers in Year 1-3)

### Traction
- ✅ Production MVP deployed (20+ dashboards)
- ✅ 100K+ lines of React/TypeScript code
- ✅ Real data integrations (AESO, StatCan, Environment Canada)
- ⏳ First pilot conversations in progress

### Team
- **Sanjay Bhargava** - 34 years software development experience
- Full-stack React/TypeScript, real-time data systems
- Energy domain expertise (built AESO integrations, carbon tracking)
- Relocating to Calgary (family connection)

### Ask
