WHY INTERIM/FRACTIONAL MODEL IS OPTIMAL
Business Case for Hiring 60-Year-Old Seasoned Professional (vs. 35-Year-Old Mid-Career):
✓ Get 34 years of wisdom without 10-year commitment — Interim/fractional = strategic flexibility. No long-term HR commitment, no career ladder expectations, no succession planning headaches.

✓ Crisis/turnaround specialist mentality — Experienced professionals thrive in complex transformations requiring stability, not experimentation. Your mission-critical systems are safe.

✓ Higher hourly/daily rates = better ROI — Interim directors earn $150-250K for 12 months vs. permanent VP at $200K+ with 5-10 year tenure expectation. Better ROI for defined transformation mandates.

✓ No office politics or ego — Focused on delivering outcomes, not climbing ladder. Mature professional comfortable with influence-without-authority model.

✓ Clear deliverables and timelines — 12-24 month transformation mandate with measurable KPIs (cost reduction, SLA improvement, time-to-market) vs. ambiguous permanent role goals.

✓ Multiple clients = portfolio resilience for me — For fractional model: If one engagement ends, others continue. Aligns incentives: I deliver value to keep clients, clients get flexibility to scale up/down.
