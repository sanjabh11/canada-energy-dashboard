### Alignment with Canada Energy Dashboard

**Strong Alignment** (90%):

✅ **Workforce Development**:
- ERA invests in technology adoption, which requires skilled workforce
- Professional training in carbon pricing, TIER compliance directly relevant
- Certificate programs support ERA-funded project success

✅ **Indigenous Consultation**:
- Indigenous Off-Diesel Initiative requires community engagement training
- Our UNDRIP/FPIC module aligns with ERA's Indigenous partnership focus

✅ **Technology Commercialization**:
- ERA projects need trained operators and managers
- Certificate holders = qualified talent pool for ERA-funded companies

✅ **Carbon Pricing Expertise**:
- TIER regulation is complex; our Policy & Regulatory track teaches compliance
- Interactive carbon credit calculator directly applicable to OBPS/TIER

### Partnership Opportunities

**Option 1: Co-branded Certificate Track**:
- "ERA-Certified: Carbon Compliance Professional"
- Target: Industrial emitters subject to TIER
- ERA gets: Talent pipeline for funded projects
- We get: Credibility, marketing reach, potential funding

**Option 2: Webinar Sponsorship**:
- ERA speakers present at monthly webinars (carbon pricing, hydrogen, grid modernization)
- ERA promoted as thought leader
- We get: Expert content, attendee growth

**Option 3: Grant Funding for Indigenous Learners**:
- ERA funds free/subsidized access for Indigenous community members

- We get: Credibility, PR

### Talking Points for Outreach

1. **Workforce Gap**: ERA invests in technology, but adoption requires skilled workforce. Our certificates train the operators, managers, and consultants who will implement ERA-funded projects.

2. **TIER Compliance**: 50+ large emitters in Alberta subject to TIER need carbon compliance expertise. Our interactive calculator and policy modules directly address this need.

3. **Indigenous Capacity Building**: ERA's Off-Diesel Initiative requires community engagement. Our UNDRIP/FPIC training supports meaningful consultation.

4. **Return on Investment**: Every $1M ERA invests in technology needs ~10-20 trained professionals to deploy. Our platform creates that talent pool.

5. **Measurement**: We can track certificate holder employment at ERA-funded companies, demonstrating tangible impact.

### Recommended Outreach Strategy

**Phase 1: Warm Introduction**:
- Research ERA board members and leadership on LinkedIn
