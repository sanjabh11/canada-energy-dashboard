## 🤖 AI Integration

### Recommendation Engine
The system uses a rule-based approach with 7+ recommendation categories:

1. **Heating Optimization** - For electric heating users in winter
2. **Time-of-Use Shifting** - For provinces with TOU pricing
3. **Heat Pump Upgrades** - With rebate matching
4. **Cooling Optimization** - Summer AC tips
5. **Smart Thermostat** - 10-15% savings potential
6. **General Conservation** - LED bulbs, unplugging, etc.
7. **EV Charging** - Optimal charging times

### Conversational AI
- **Production**: Gemini 2.5 Pro via Edge Function
- **Development**: Rule-based mock responses

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### Adding New Rebates

Edit `supabase/migrations/20250104_household_advisor_tables.sql`:

```sql
INSERT INTO energy_rebates VALUES
  ('your-rebate-id', 'Rebate Name', 'provincial', 'ON', 100, 5000, 'heat-pump', 
   '{"homeOwner": true}'::jsonb,
   'https://application-url.ca',
   'Description of the rebate program',
   '6-8 weeks', true);
```

### Adding New Recommendations

Edit `src/lib/energyRecommendations.ts`:

```typescript
// Add new rule in generateRecommendations function
if (/* your condition */) {
  recommendations.push({
    id: 'your-recommendation-id',
    category: 'behavioral',
    priority: 'high',
    title: 'Your Recommendation Title',
    description: 'Why this matters...',
    potentialSavings: { monthly: 25, annual: 300, kwh: 100, co2Reduction: 50 },
    effort: 'easy',
    actionSteps: [
      { step: 'First action', estimatedTime: '5 minutes', difficulty: 'easy', cost: 0 }
    ]
  });
}
```

### Customizing Provincial Pricing

Edit `src/components/HouseholdEnergyAdvisor.tsx`:

```typescript
const PROVINCIAL_PRICING: Record<Province, ProvincialPricing> = {
  ON: {
    province: 'ON',
    currentPrice: 12.5,
    hasTOUPricing: true,
    touRates: {
      offPeak: 8.7,
      midPeak: 12.2,
      onPeak: 15.1,
      offPeakHours: '19:00-07:00, weekends',
      onPeakHours: '11:00-17:00 weekdays',
    },
    lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
  // Add/update other provinces
};
```
