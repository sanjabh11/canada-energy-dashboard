  consumption_kwh: 950,
  cost_cad: 142,
  peakUsageHours: [7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21],
  weather: { avgTemp: -8, heatingDegreeDays: 700, coolingDegreeDays: 0 }
});

// Add February usage
householdDataManager.saveUsage({
  month: '2025-02',
  consumption_kwh: 850,
  cost_cad: 127,
  peakUsageHours: [7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 20],
