## Phase 4 Implementation Plan (Detailed)

### Guiding Objectives
- **Performance Optimization**: Drive the average API response time below 500â¯ms and reach 99.5% uptime by hardening data pipelines, adding caching, and tuning Supabase policies.
- **Advanced AI Delivery**: Deploy GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro prompts through a centralized LLM service with human-in-the-loop review, logging, and confidence scoring.
- **International & Federated Data**: Expand ingestion to cross-border datasets while respecting provincial and Indigenous data sovereignty via granular row-level security (RLS).
- **Stakeholder-Centered Value**: Ensure each federal, provincial, Indigenous, industry, and community persona receives tangible workflow improvements tied to their user story.

### Core Workstreams
- **Data Foundation & Quality (WF-1)**
  - Finalize missing core tables via `supabase/migrations/20250927_create_missing_core_tables.sql` and related seeds.
  - Implement automated data validation jobs and surface quality metrics through `/api/v2/data/quality-metrics`.
  - Establish data provenance logs and unresolved-data queues for manual review.
- **Priority API Services (WF-2)**
  - Harden existing edge functions (e.g., `supabase/functions/api-v2-resilience-assets/`) with error handling, caching, and pagination.
  - Deliver remaining API endpoints for Stories #1â#8, following the REST conventions in `prd.md`.
  - Document every endpoint in OpenAPI and publish to the developer portal.
- **Streaming & Optimization Layer (WF-3)**
  - Stabilize the four live streams (`stream-ontario-demand`, `stream-provincial-generation`, `stream-ontario-prices`, `stream-hf-electricity-demand`).
  - Introduce Redis-backed caching for high-traffic metrics and pre-compute trend aggregates.
  - Add observability hooks (Prometheus or Supabase logs) with alerting on latency and error budgets.
- **AI & Insight Delivery (WF-4)**
  - Centralize GPT-5 and Gemini prompts in `src/lib/aiOracle.ts` with versioned configurations.
  - Implement confidence scoring, rationale logging, and human override tooling for critical recommendations.
  - Run supervised fine-tuning cycles using anonymized feedback collected from Story owners.
- **Security, Sovereignty & Compliance (WF-5)**
  - Enforce RLS across all Phase 4 tables with persona-based policies (federal, provincial, Indigenous, public).
  - Implement audit trails for Indigenous data access and integrate sovereignty agreements into consent workflows.
  - Complete ITSG-33 security review, update `SECURITY.md`, and schedule penetration testing.
- **Stakeholder Experience & UX (WF-6)**
  - Map user journeys for the top six personas and align frontend components under `src/components/` to the new APIs.
  - Ensure WCAGâ¯2.1 compliance and introduce localization hooks for multilingual delivery.
  - Produce training assets and onboarding dashboards for each persona group.
  - Deploy contextual help overlays and tooltips with the `HelpButton` pattern across dashboards (see plan below).

### Contextual Help & Education Plan (WF-6E)
- **Content Architecture**
  - Audit `supabase/functions/help/index.ts` and `supabase/migrations/20250903_help_content.sql` to guarantee every active `HelpButton` ID has curated markdown content with provenance links.
  - Maintain help authoring guidelines so Indigenous, provincial, and federal stakeholders can review updates before publication.
- **Component Instrumentation**
  - `src/components/EnergyDataDashboard.tsx`: confirm top-level ribbon help aligns each tab with `HelpButton` IDs (e.g., `page.indigenous`, `page.stakeholders`).
  - `src/components/IndigenousDashboard.tsx`: add inline help triggers for the sovereignty overview and territory map sections (`module.indigenous.overview`, `module.indigenous.map`).
  - `src/components/StakeholderDashboard.tsx`: surface contextual guidance for the consultation workspace (`module.stakeholder.overview`) and collaboration metrics.
  - Real-time analytics cards (e.g., Alberta supply/demand) expose specific chart help (`chart.alberta_supply_demand`).
- **Feedback & Iteration**
  - Capture help usage analytics and optional feedback via `help_feedback` to inform monthly content revisions.
  - Schedule quarterly reviews with Indigenous governance advisors to validate sovereignty-related help entries.
