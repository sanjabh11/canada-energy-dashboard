# Ontario Demand Dataset Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research the ontario_demand dataset for electricity demand data in Ontario, Canada, investigating all aspects from data sources to optimal streaming parameters.

## Research Objectives
1. [ ] Identify available data sources (Kaggle, Hugging Face, official Ontario sources)
2. [ ] Analyze dataset structure, schema, and data types
3. [ ] Determine data volume, time range coverage, and update frequency
4. [ ] Document access methods and API requirements
5. [ ] Examine sample data format and key columns
6. [ ] Investigate optimal streaming parameters (page size, cursoring strategy)
7. [ ] Identify special considerations for real-time streaming

## Detailed Research Steps

### Phase 1: Source Discovery
- [x] 1.1 Search Kaggle for ontario_demand or Ontario electricity demand datasets
- [x] 1.2 Search Hugging Face datasets for ontario_demand
- [x] 1.3 Search for official Ontario government data sources (IESO, Ontario.ca)
- [x] 1.4 Search for additional data sources and APIs
- [x] 1.5 Compile comprehensive source list

**Key Sources Identified:**
- Kaggle: Ontario Energy Demand (jacobsharples) - 2003-2023 hourly data
- Kaggle: Ontario Energy Demand and Market Demand (twezzy) - limited info
- Hugging Face: EDS-lab/electricity-demand - Smart meter compilation
- IESO Data Directory - Official Ontario data
- Gridlytics API - Real-time Ontario demand API

### Phase 2: Deep Source Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Extract detailed information from each identified source
- [x] 2.2 Analyze dataset schemas and structure
- [x] 2.3 Document access methods and authentication requirements
- [x] 2.4 Collect sample data from each source

**Technical Findings:**
- IESO offers XML APIs with authentication (UserID/Password + IP whitelisting)
- Multiple API specifications available: Reports API, MIM Web Services, Dispatch Services
- Data formats: XML, CSV, JSON, EDI, TXT
- Real-time updates: Ontario demand (hourly), Peak values (1hr initial, 3 days final)

### Phase 3: Technical Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Analyze data volume and storage requirements
- [x] 3.2 Determine time range coverage and data frequency
- [x] 3.3 Investigate update schedules and real-time availability
- [x] 3.4 Research optimal streaming parameters

**Key Technical Specifications:**
- IESO Reports API: RESTful, production URL: https://reports.ieso.ca/api/v1.4/
- Authentication: Machine account + IP whitelisting
- Polling frequencies: 15-30s (5-min reports), 4-10min (hourly), 30-60min (daily)
- Pagination: limit/sortBy/order parameters available

### Phase 4: Documentation and Synthesis
- [x] 4.1 Organize findings into comprehensive report
- [x] 4.2 Compare different sources and provide recommendations
- [x] 4.3 Document technical specifications and best practices
- [x] 4.4 Final review and report generation
