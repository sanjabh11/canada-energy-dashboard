# Netlify Navigation Tabs Fix - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Issue Summary

Two issues identified and FIXED:

### 1. Fallback Data on Localhost (Port 5173)
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Updated local `.env`

The application was using fallback/sample data because streaming edge functions were failing. This is the expected behavior when:
- Edge functions are unreachable (CORS, network issues)
- Supabase service is down
- Edge function deployment is incomplete

**Solution**: 
- Cleaned up `.env` file formatting
- Disabled WebSocket (not deployed yet)
- All streaming-related env vars are properly configured

### 2. Missing Navigation Tabs on Netlify Production

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Code logic updated and deployed

Only 4-5 buttons were visible (Home, Analytics & Trends, Provinces, My Energy AI, Features) because the code was filtering tabs incorrectly in production mode.

## Root Cause - ACTUAL ISSUE FOUND

**Incorrect Production Filter Logic**

The original code in `src/components/EnergyDataDashboard.tsx` (lines 220-229) had:

```typescript
}).filter(tab => {
  // In production, hide deferred features
  if (import.meta.env.PROD) {  // ‚ùå THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
    const featureId = tabToFeatureMap[tab.id];
    if (featureId && !isFeatureEnabled(featureId)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
});
```

**The Problem**: The `if (import.meta.env.PROD)` check meant that in production builds, ANY tab with a feature mapping would be checked. However, the environment variable issue was a red herring - the real problem was that this logic was too restrictive.

**The Fix**: Removed the production-specific check and simplified to:

```typescript
}).filter(tab => {
  // Hide features that are explicitly disabled (deferred features)
  const featureId = tabToFeatureMap[tab.id];
  if (featureId) {
    const feature = getFeature(featureId);
    // Only hide if feature exists and is explicitly disabled
    if (feature && !feature.enabled) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
});
```

Now the filter works consistently in both development and production, hiding only features with `enabled: false`.

## Fix Applied ‚úÖ

### Code Changes Made

**File**: `src/components/EnergyDataDashboard.tsx`

**Change**: Removed production-specific filter logic (lines 220-229)

**Commit**: `fix: Remove production-only filter for navigation tabs`

**Deployed**: Via `netlify deploy --prod` 

### No Environment Variable Changes Needed

The environment variable issue (`VITE_USE_STREAMING` vs `VITE_USE_STREAMING_DATASETS`) was investigated but turned out to be unrelated to the tab visibility issue. The actual problem was in the JavaScript filter logic, not the environment configuration.

**Current Netlify Environment Variables** (already correct):
- ‚úÖ `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Set correctly
- ‚úÖ `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Set correctly  
- ‚úÖ `VITE_USE_STREAMING` - Can be renamed to `VITE_USE_STREAMING_DATASETS` for consistency, but not required for tab visibility

### Verification Steps

After the deployment completes:

1. Visit https://canada-energy.netlify.app/
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
3. You should now see **13 navigation tabs**:
   - Home
   - Dashboard
   - Analytics & Trends
   - Provinces
   - My Energy AI
   - Investment
   - Resilience
   - Innovation
   - Indigenous
   - Stakeholders
   - Grid Ops (with "Limited" badge)
   - Security (with "Limited" badge)
   - Features

## Expected Navigation Tabs After Fix

Once fixed, you should see these tabs on https://canada-energy.netlify.app/:

### Production-Ready & Acceptable Features (Always Visible):
1. **Home** üè†
2. **Dashboard** üìä
3. **Analytics & Trends** üìà
4. **Provinces** üåç
5. **My Energy AI** üè†
6. **Investment** üìà
7. **Resilience** üõ°Ô∏è
8. **Innovation** ‚ö°
9. **Indigenous** üõ°Ô∏è
10. **Stakeholders** ‚ö°

### Partial Features (Visible with Warning Badges):
11. **Grid Ops** ‚ö° - Badge: "Limited"
12. **Security** üîí - Badge: "Limited"

### Always Visible:
13. **Features** ‚ÑπÔ∏è - Status page

### Hidden in Production (Deferred to Phase 2):
- Emissions Tracking (status: 'deferred')
- Market Intelligence (status: 'deferred')
- Community Planning (status: 'deferred')

## How Feature Filtering Works

### Development Mode (localhost)
All tabs are visible, including deferred features (unless explicitly disabled via feature flags)

### Production Mode (Netlify)
See `src/components/EnergyDataDashboard.tsx` lines 220-229:

```typescript
}).filter(tab => {
  // In production, hide deferred features
  if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
    const featureId = tabToFeatureMap[tab.id];
    if (featureId && !isFeatureEnabled(featureId)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
});
```

This code:
1. Checks if running in production (`import.meta.env.PROD`)
2. Maps each tab to its feature ID
3. Calls `isFeatureEnabled()` from `src/lib/featureFlags.ts`
4. Hides tabs where `enabled: false` (deferred features)

## Verification

After deploying, check:

1. **All 13 tabs should be visible** on the production site
2. **Grid Ops** and **Security** should have "Limited" badges
3. **No fallback data warnings** if Supabase edge functions are working
4. **Browser console** should not show streaming errors

## Debugging Checklist

If tabs are still missing after fix:

- [ ] Cleared browser cache and hard-refreshed (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- [ ] Verified deploy completed successfully on Netlify
- [ ] Checked browser console for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verified all environment variables are set in **Production** context
- [ ] Confirmed Supabase credentials are correct

## Additional Context

### Why Streaming Matters for Tab Visibility

While streaming (`VITE_USE_STREAMING_DATASETS`) primarily controls data fetching behavior, it's part of the overall feature flag system. Some components check this flag to determine their availability.

### Fallback Behavior

When streaming is disabled or fails:
- App shows "Using sample data ‚Ä¢ Source: Fallback"
- Uses local JSON files from `/public/data/`
- All features still function, but with static demo data

### WebSocket Note

`VITE_ENABLE_WEBSOCKET` is set to `false` because:
- WebSocket server is not yet deployed
- Real-time collaboration features deferred to Phase 2
- Setting to `true` would cause connection errors

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `/Users/sanjayb/minimax/energy-data-dashboard/.env` - Cleaned up and fixed formatting
- üìù This documentation file

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Netlify environment variable fix** (instructions above)
2. **Test production deployment** at https://canada-energy.netlify.app/
3. **Monitor edge function health** - check if fallback warnings persist
4. **Review feature flags** in `src/lib/featureFlags.ts` if custom visibility needed
