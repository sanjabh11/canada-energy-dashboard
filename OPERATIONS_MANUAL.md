## üîç DAILY HEALTH CHECKS

### Morning Health Check (15 minutes - 9:00 AM)

# Check if app is accessible
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Expected: HTTP 200 OK
```

**‚úÖ Pass**: Application loads within 3 seconds  
**‚ö†Ô∏è Investigate**: Load time >5 seconds  
**‚ùå Escalate**: Application unreachable or 500 errors

#### 2. Supabase Dashboard Review
Navigate to: https://app.supabase.com/project/[your-project-ref]

üìä 20 features available
```

**Development Mode** (if testing):
```
‚úÖ Feature flags validated successfully
üìä Deployment stats: {...}
üöÄ Phase 1 Launch: 20/24 features enabled
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required if**:

## üõ†Ô∏è COMMON ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: "Feature Not Available" / 404 Errors

**Symptoms**:
- User reports feature not accessible
- Tab missing from navigation
- Page shows 404 or blank

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check if feature is deferred (should be hidden in production)
2. Verify feature flag configuration
3. Check browser console for errors

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Verify in browser console
import { getFeature } from './lib/featureFlags';
console.log(getFeature('feature_id'));

// Expected output should show feature config
```

**If feature should be visible**:
1. Check `FEATURE_REGISTRY` in `src/lib/featureFlags.ts`
2. Verify `enabled: true`
3. Confirm not marked as `deferred`

**Resolution Time**: 5-10 minutes

---

### Issue 2: IESO Streaming Data Not Updating

**Symptoms**:
- Timestamp not changing
- "Connection Lost" message
- Stale data (>10 minutes old)

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check IESO API status: https://www.ieso.ca/
2. Review Supabase Edge Function logs
3. Check network tab for failed requests

**Troubleshooting Steps**:

```bash
# 1. Check Edge Function status
# Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí ieso-ontario-demand

# 2. Check logs
# Look for errors or rate limiting

# 3. Manual test
curl https://[your-project].functions.supabase.co/ieso-ontario-demand \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [anon-key]" \
  -H "apikey: [anon-key]"
```

**Common Causes**:
- IESO API maintenance (check their status page)
- Rate limiting (wait 5 minutes, should recover)
- Supabase quota exceeded (check dashboard)
- Network issue (check Supabase status)

**Temporary Workaround**:
- App will fall back to cached data automatically
- Users should see "Using cached data" notice

**Resolution Time**: 15-30 minutes (or wait for IESO API recovery)

---

### Issue 3: LLM Features Not Responding

**Symptoms**:
- "Explain Chart" button does nothing
- Loading spinner never stops
- Error: "Failed to generate explanation"

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check Gemini API key validity
2. Review rate limiting status
3. Check Edge Function logs for LLM calls

**Troubleshooting**:

```bash
# Check environment variables
# Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Environment

# Required:
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-key>
LLM_ENABLED=true
LLM_MAX_RPM=30
```

**Common Causes**:
- Gemini API key expired or invalid
- Rate limit exceeded (30 requests/minute)
- Gemini API service outage
- Network connectivity issue

**Solutions**:
1. **Rate Limited**: Wait 1 minute, try again
2. **Invalid Key**: Update API key in Supabase settings
3. **API Outage**: Check Google AI status page

**Resolution Time**: 5-10 minutes (unless external service issue)

---

### Issue 4: Features Show "Limited" Badge Unexpectedly

**Symptoms**:
- Yellow "Limited" badge on feature that should be production-ready
- User confused about feature status

**Diagnosis**:
This is **expected behavior** for:
- Grid Optimization (partial: 3.6/5)
- Security Assessment (partial: 3.7/5)
- Minerals Dashboard (partial: 3.8/5) - if accessible

**Verification**:
```typescript
// Check feature status
import { getFeature } from './lib/featureFlags';
console.log(getFeature('grid_optimization'));
// Should show status: 'partial'
```

**If badge is incorrect**:
1. Check `FEATURE_REGISTRY` in `src/lib/featureFlags.ts`
2. Verify rating and status match
3. Update if needed and redeploy

**User Communication**:
"This feature is available with documented limitations. Click the Features tab to see details."

**Resolution Time**: Immediate (provide explanation)

---

### Issue 5: Console Shows Feature Flag Validation Errors

**Symptoms** (Dev mode only):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Feature flag validation failed: [errors]
```

**Diagnosis**:
Feature flag configuration inconsistency detected

**Common Errors**:
1. **"Rating doesn't match status"**
   - Fix: Update rating or status in `FEATURE_REGISTRY`
   
2. **"Deferred feature enabled=true"**
   - Fix: Set `enabled: false` for deferred features
   
3. **"Missing required fields"**
   - Fix: Add missing `id`, `name`, `status`, or `rating`

**Solution**:
1. Fix issues in `src/lib/featureFlags.ts`
2. Commit and deploy
3. Validation should pass on next load

**Resolution Time**: 10-15 minutes
