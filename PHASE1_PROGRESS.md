## 📝 NOTES & DECISIONS

### Design Decisions Made
1. **Feature Flag Architecture**: Centralized registry vs distributed config
   - **Chose**: Centralized registry in single file for consistency
   - **Rationale**: Single source of truth, easier to validate

2. **Status Badge Design**: Always visible vs on-demand
   - **Chose**: Compact badges always visible, details on-demand
   - **Rationale**: Balance transparency with UI clutter

3. **Warning Placement**: Top of page vs inline
   - **Chose**: Top of page for high visibility
   - **Rationale**: Users see limitations before using features

4. **Deferred Feature Access**: Block vs show with notice
   - **Chose**: Show with prominent "Coming Soon" notice
   - **Rationale**: Sets expectations, collects interest signals

### Challenges Encountered
- ✅ **Resolved**: TypeScript type safety for feature configs
- ✅ **Resolved**: Container class naming in FeatureAvailability
- **Pending**: Ensuring all 48 components checked for feature status

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Users confused by partial features
  - **Mitigation**: Prominent yellow warnings, clear limitation lists
- **Risk**: Feature flag config out of sync with reality
  - **Mitigation**: Automated validation on app init, throws errors if inconsistent
- **Risk**: Too many warnings create alarm fatigue
  - **Mitigation**: Color-coded severity (green/blue/yellow/gray)
