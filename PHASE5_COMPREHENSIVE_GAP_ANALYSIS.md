## 🎯 LLM PROMPT IMPROVEMENTS FOR 5X EFFECTIVENESS

### Current Effectiveness: 3X

**What Works:**
- ✅ Warm, empathetic tone
- ✅ Canadian context (provinces, programs, weather)
- ✅ Actionable recommendations
- ✅ Specific numbers and savings
- ✅ Household profile integration

**Limitations:**
- ❌ No awareness of Phase 5 features
- ❌ Can't reference live battery state
- ❌ Doesn't know about curtailment events
- ❌ Missing renewable forecast integration
- ❌ No real-time market price guidance

### Target Effectiveness: 5X

**Required Enhancements:**

#### 1. **Storage Dispatch Integration**
Add to prompt context:
```typescript
**Current Battery State**:
- Province: ${batteryState.province}
- State of Charge: ${batteryState.soc_percent}%
- Available Capacity: ${batteryState.capacity_mwh - batteryState.soc_mwh} MWh
- Power Rating: ${batteryState.power_rating_mw} MW
- Last Action: ${lastDispatch.action} at ${lastDispatch.dispatched_at}
- Renewable Absorption: ${lastDispatch.renewable_absorption ? 'Active' : 'Inactive'}
```

**New Capabilities:**
- "When should I charge my EV to help absorb surplus renewables?"
- "Is now a good time to run my pool pump? (curtailment mitigation)"
- "How much renewable energy is being wasted right now?"

#### 2. **Curtailment Event Awareness**
Add to prompt context:
```typescript
**Recent Curtailment Events**:
- Events This Month: ${curtailmentCount}
- Total MWh Curtailed: ${totalCurtailed}
- AI-Avoided: ${aiAvoided} MWh (${reductionPercent}%)
- Next Predicted Event: ${nextEvent.occurred_at} (${nextEvent.probability}% confidence)
```

**New Capabilities:**
- "There's a curtailment event predicted tomorrow at 2 PM - perfect time to charge your EV!"
- "We've helped avoid 3,500 MWh of curtailment this month - you're part of that!"
- "Your flexible load could earn $X by shifting to curtailment windows"

#### 3. **Renewable Forecast Integration**
Add to prompt context:
```typescript
**Renewable Forecasts (Next 24h)**:
- Solar: ${solarForecast.predicted_output_mw} MW (${solarForecast.confidence_level} confidence)
- Wind: ${windForecast.predicted_output_mw} MW (${windForecast.confidence_level} confidence)
- Baseline Comparison: ${improvementPercent}% better than persistence
- Oversupply Risk: ${oversupplyRisk}% (${oversupplyHours} hours)
```

**New Capabilities:**
- "Solar generation will peak at 2 PM tomorrow - great time for heavy loads"
- "Wind is forecast to surge tonight - cheapest electricity of the week!"
- "Our AI predicts 6 hours of oversupply this weekend - plan your laundry!"

#### 4. **Market Price Guidance**
Add to prompt context:
```typescript
**Current Market Conditions**:
- Current Price: ${currentPrice}¢/kWh (${priceLevel}: low/medium/high)
- Peak Price Today: ${peakPrice}¢/kWh at ${peakTime}
- Lowest Price Today: ${lowPrice}¢/kWh at ${lowTime}
- Price Forecast (Next 6h): ${priceForecast}
- Curtailment Risk: ${curtailmentRisk}% (negative pricing possible)
```

**New Capabilities:**
- "Electricity is 60% cheaper right now than peak - run your dryer!"
- "Prices will spike in 2 hours - delay that dishwasher load"
- "Negative pricing expected at 1 PM - you could get paid to use electricity!"

#### 5. **Specialized Response Templates**

**Template: Storage Dispatch Recommendation**
```
User asks: "When should I charge my EV?"

AI Response Framework:
1. Check current battery SoC and renewable forecast
2. Identify optimal charging window (low price + high renewables)
3. Calculate savings vs. peak charging
4. Mention curtailment mitigation benefit
5. Provide specific time recommendation

Example:
"Perfect timing! Here's your optimal EV charging plan:

**Best Window**: Tonight 11 PM - 6 AM
- Price: 8.2¢/kWh (off-peak)
- Renewable Mix: 65% wind (high generation forecast)
- Grid Battery: Charging mode (absorbing surplus)
- Your Savings: $4.50 vs. peak charging

**Why This Matters**:
- You're helping absorb surplus wind energy that would otherwise be curtailed
- Provincial battery is also charging - you're part of the grid optimization!
- This saves you money AND reduces renewable waste

**Bonus**: Set your charger to start at 11 PM. Your car will be full by morning, and you've maximized clean energy use. 🌱"
```

**Template: Curtailment Opportunity Alert**
```
User asks: "How can I save more money?"

AI Response (when curtailment predicted):
"I have exciting news! There's a rare opportunity tomorrow:

**Curtailment Event Predicted**: Tomorrow 1-4 PM
- Solar: 6,500 MW (record high)
- Wind: 4,200 MW (strong winds)
- Demand: Only 13,000 MW (mild weather)
- **Result**: 2,700 MW surplus - prices will crash!

**Your Action Plan**:
1. **Run ALL heavy loads** during 1-4 PM:
   - Dishwasher: Save $0.80
   - Laundry (2 loads): Save $1.60
   - Pool pump (if applicable): Save $2.40
   - **Total Savings**: $4.80 for 3 hours

2. **Charge EV** (if applicable): Save $6.50 vs. overnight

3. **Pre-cool home** to 20°C: Free AC, saves $3 tonight

**Why This Is Special**:
- This happens only ~20 times per year
- You're helping prevent 2,700 MW of renewable curtailment
- Electricity might even be FREE or negative (you get paid!)

Want me to send you a reminder at 12:30 PM tomorrow?"
```

**Template: Renewable Forecast Explanation**
```
User asks: "Why are you recommending this time?"

AI Response:
"Great question! Let me show you the data behind my recommendation:

**Our AI Forecast** (Next 6 hours):
- Solar: 2,400 MW → 3,800 MW → 4,200 MW (peaking at 2 PM)
- Wind: 1,800 MW → 2,100 MW → 2,400 MW (steady increase)
- Total Renewables: 6,600 MW by 2 PM

**Baseline Comparison**:
- Persistence Model: Would predict 2,200 MW (56% error!)
- Our AI: Predicts 4,200 MW (6.5% error historically)
- **We're 56% more accurate** than simple forecasts

**What This Means For You**:
- 2 PM will have the MOST clean energy of the day
- Grid will have surplus capacity
- Prices will be lowest
- Your usage helps absorb renewable surplus

**Data Transparency**:
- Weather: 15% cloud cover, 18 km/h winds (Open-Meteo)
- Historical Accuracy: 720 forecasts, 6.5% MAE
- Confidence: HIGH (98% data completeness)

This is why I'm confident recommending 2 PM for your heavy loads!"
