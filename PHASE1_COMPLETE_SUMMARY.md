## 🎯 FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Real-Time Grid Context** ✅
Every LLM call now fetches and includes:
- **Battery State:** SoC, capacity, power rating (4 provinces)
- **Curtailment Events:** Active events, opportunity cost
- **Forecast Performance:** Solar/wind MAE, confidence scores
- **Storage Dispatch:** Recent charge/discharge actions
- **Market Pricing:** HOEP, global adjustment

**Data Sources:** 5 tables queried in real-time

### **2. Optimization Opportunity Detection** ✅
LLM analyzes grid state and suggests:
- **Battery Discharge:** High SoC + High pricing → $7,000 revenue
- **Curtailment Absorption:** Active curtailment → Charge battery
- **Low Pricing Windows:** HOEP < $20 → EV charging opportunity
- **Forecast Degradation:** MAE increasing → Model review needed

**Detection Algorithms:** 5 implemented in opportunity-detector

### **3. Specialized Prompt Templates** ✅
8 templates created for different use cases:
1. `buildChartExplanationPrompt()` - Chart analysis with optimization
2. `buildAnalyticsInsightPrompt()` - Deep data analysis
3. `buildTransitionReportPrompt()` - Energy transition progress
4. `buildDataQualityPrompt()` - Quality assessment
5. `buildHouseholdAdvisorPrompt()` - Personalized advice
6. `buildGridOptimizationPrompt()` - Grid recommendations
7. `buildCurtailmentAlertPrompt()` - Urgent alerts
8. `buildStorageDispatchPrompt()` - Battery dispatch reasoning

**All templates:** Grid-aware, optimization-focused, Canadian context

### **4. Data Provenance Tracking** ✅
Every response includes:
```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "type": "real-time",
      "table": "batteries_state",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-12T12:45:00Z",
      "confidence": 95,
      "record_count": 4
    }
  ],
  "grid_context_used": true,
  "optimization_suggested": true
}
```

### **5. Graceful Error Handling** ✅
- Try/catch around all LLM calls
- Fallback to static responses if LLM fails
- Errors logged but not exposed to users
- `X-LLM-Mode: active` or `fallback` header
- No breaking changes for existing clients

  "opportunities": [],
  "summary": {
    "total_count": 0,
    "high_severity": 0,
    "medium_severity": 0,
    "low_severity": 0,
