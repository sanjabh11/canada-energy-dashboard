# ‚úÖ Issues Fixed - Household Energy Advisor

## Issue #1: Database Migration Timestamp ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Migration file dated January 2025 conflicted with September 2025 migrations

**Solution**: Renamed migration file
```bash
20250104_household_advisor_tables.sql ‚Üí 20251004_household_advisor_tables.sql
```

**Status**: File renamed, ready to push with `supabase db push`

## Issue #2: Mock Data / No Recommendations ‚úÖ FIXED

### Root Cause
The recommendation engine required usage data to generate recommendations. Without it:
- ‚ùå 0 recommendations shown
- ‚ùå Chat gave generic responses
- ‚ùå Analytics showed empty charts
- ‚ùå "Potential Savings: $0/year"

### What Changed

#### 1. Added Usage Estimation Algorithm
```typescript
// NEW function in energyRecommendations.ts
estimateUsageFromProfile(profile) {
  // Calculates expected usage based on:
  - Home size (sq ft)
  - Occupants
  - Heating type (electric adds 40%)
  - AC (adds 15%)
  - EV (adds 300 kWh)
  - Solar (reduces by 40%)
}
```

**Your Profile Result**:
- Alberta, 1500 sq ft, 2 people, gas heating
- Has: AC, Solar, EV
- **Estimated Usage: ~600 kWh/month**

#### 2. Added Profile-Based Recommendations

Now generates recommendations WITHOUT usage data:

| # | Recommendation | Based On | Est. Savings |
|---|----------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Smart Thermostat** | All profiles | $108/year |
| 2 | **General Conservation** | All profiles | $86/year |
| 3 | **EV Charging** | Has EV | $180/year |
| 4 | **Heat Pump** | Gas heating in AB | $600/year |

#### 3. Enhanced AI Chat Responses

**Before**:
```
Q: "How can I reduce my bill?"
A: "That's a great question! Based on your house in AB..."
```

**After**:
```
Q: "How can I reduce my bill?"
A: "Based on your profile, here are personalized tips:
   1. Install smart thermostat - Save $108/year
   2. Optimize EV charging - Save $180/year
   3. Heat pump upgrade eligible for $10,000 rebate"
```

## üß™ Test Now

### Step 1: Refresh the Page
```bash
# The dev server should auto-reload
# Or manually refresh: http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 2: Navigate to "My Energy AI" Tab

### Step 3: Check Overview Tab

You should NOW see:
- ‚úÖ 3-5 recommendations (not zero!)
- ‚úÖ Estimated savings amounts
- ‚úÖ Top recommendations displayed
- ‚úÖ Rebates still matched (4 programs, $25,150)

### Step 4: Try the Chat

Ask these questions:
1. "How can I reduce my bill?"
2. "Should I get a smart thermostat?"
3. "When should I charge my EV?"
4. "What rebates am I eligible for?"

Expected: **Specific, contextual answers** (not generic)

### Step 5: Add Real Usage Data (Optional)

Open browser console on the Household Advisor page:

```javascript
// Get your actual electricity bill and enter real values
const { householdDataManager } = await import('./src/lib/householdDataManager.js');

// Example with real data
householdDataManager.saveUsage({
  month: '2025-01',      // Your billing month
  consumption_kwh: 850,  // Your actual kWh from bill
  cost_cad: 127.50,      // Your actual cost from bill
  peakUsageHours: [],    // Leave empty for now
  weather: null,         // Leave null for now
});

// Refresh to see updated recommendations
location.reload();
```

**After adding real data**:
- Charts will populate
- Recommendations will use ACTUAL usage
- Savings calculations more precise
- Chat becomes even smarter

Average Monthly Bill: $108
Available Rebates: $25,150 from 4 programs
Potential Savings: $400-800/year from 4 recommendations ‚úÖ

```

### Chat Tab
```
AI: "üëã Hi! I'm your personal Energy AI advisor.
     I know you live in AB, have a house with 2 people,
     and use gas heating with EV, AC, and solar.
     
     What would you like to know?"

You: "How can I save money?"

AI: "Based on your profile, I've identified 4 ways you could save:
    
     üí∞ Total Potential Savings: $974/year
     
     Top 3 Quick Wins:
     1. Install Smart Thermostat

- Estimated benchmark: 605 kWh
- Profile summary with all your details
- Placeholder charts
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "No Recommendations"?

**Fix 1**: Hard refresh
```bash
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
```

**Fix 2**: Clear localStorage and re-onboard
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
// Go through onboarding again
```

**Fix 3**: Check console for errors
```javascript
// Press F12, check Console tab
// Look for errors in red
```

### Chat still giving generic responses?

**Check**: Make sure you completed onboarding
- Profile must be saved
- Province selected
- Home details filled

**Verify**:
```javascript
const { householdDataManager } = await import('./src/lib/householdDataManager.js');
const profile = householdDataManager.getProfile();
console.log(profile); // Should show your details
```

### Recommendations not calculating savings?

**Check provincial pricing**:
```javascript
// In src/components/HouseholdEnergyAdvisor.tsx
// Line 44-48: AB pricing should be 18.0 ¬¢/kWh
AB: {
  province: 'AB',
  currentPrice: 18.0,  // ‚Üê Should be 18.0
  hasTOUPricing: false,
  lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString(),
}
```
