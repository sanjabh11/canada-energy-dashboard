#	PRD user story (short)	Score	Evidence (what is implemented now)	Missing / Gap (what to add)	LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) value-add	Concrete LLM integration steps & endpoint
1	Energy System Analytics Dashboard (policy analyst)	5	Dashboard UI + 4 panels, streaming failover, IndexedDB caching, manifest endpoints. Enhanced analytics-insight endpoint with RAG for multi-dataset insights, citations, scenario comparisons. NOW COMPLETE: MineralsDashboard.tsx with maps and risk alerts, ComplianceDashboard.tsx with violation logs and audit trails.	Gemini synthesizes trends, produces policy implications, creates natural-language "insights" and Q&A about the dashboard data with cited sources.	Endpoint /api/llm/analytics-insight enhanced to accept datasetIds array, timeframe, queryType, focus → server retrieves manifest + samples for each → RAG → Gemini. System prompt: Energy Analytics Assistant.
2	Indigenous Energy Sovereignty Tracker	5	Implemented FPIC workflow with consent recording, localized knowledge handling, access controls, Indigenous-authored content, formal consultation trackers.	Gemini acts as respectful assistant: draft consultation checklists, surface culturally relevant questions, summarize impacts in plain language — but never replaces Indigenous decision-making.	Endpoints /indigenous/projects /consultation-status /impact-assessment implemented with K-anonymization, explicit guardrails, and human-in-the-loop.
3	Grid Integration Optimization Tool (operator)	5	Implemented real-time optimization module, constraint solver, integration with IESO/AESO real-time telemetry.	Gemini produces human-readable operational recommendations, translates model outputs into runbooks; optimization runs in deterministic simulation engine (not LLM). Use LLM for interpretation & explanation only.	Endpoint /grid/optimization-scenario implemented with server-side optimization and Gemini for explanation.
4	Investment Decision Support	5	Implemented investment_projects and esg_data tables, NPV/IRR calculations, endpoints /investment/project-analysis /portfolio-optimization with Gemini for risk summaries, UI investment cards with scores, portfolio views.	Financial modelling, portfolio optimization, NPV/IRR runs, ESG scoring and scenario comparisons.	Gemini summarizes project risks, generates checklists, creates investor-facing summaries. Do not allow legal/financial advice without human sign-off.	Endpoints /investment/project-analysis /portfolio-optimization implemented with RAG and recommendations labeled "informational".
| 5 | Carbon Emissions Tracking & Planner | 4.5 | Implemented endpoint /emissions-planner, UI EmissionsPlanner.tsx, data EmissionsStreamer, archival with history fallback. | More multi-variate analytics (automated insights), scenario explainers, RAG-driven citations. | Gemini can synthesize trends, produce policy implications, create natural-language "insights" and Q&A about the dashboard data with cited sources. | Create endpoint /api/llm/emissions-planner that accepts datasetIds, timeframe, queryType → server does retrieval (manifest + recent pages) → RAG → Gemini. System prompt: Energy Analytics Assistant. |
| 9 | Energy Market Intelligence Platform | 4.5 | Implemented endpoint /market-brief, UI MarketIntelligence.tsx, data MarketStreamer, archival with history fallback. | Price forecasting models, trading signal support, risk alerts. | Gemini can summarize market drivers, generate plain-language briefings, and produce scenario narratives; do not use LLM for automated trading signals. | Endpoint /api/llm/market-brief. Integrate short RAG context from recent news (Perplexity) & market data. |
| 6 | Community Energy Planning Assistant | 4.5 | Implemented endpoint /community-plan, UI CommunityPlanner.tsx, data CommunityStreamer, archival with history fallback. | Templates for local energy plans, customized incentives mapping, community-facing UI. | Gemini can auto-generate a draft local plan (starter text, steps, funding sources) given chosen constraints and community data. Must provide citations and require human review. | Endpoint /api/llm/community-plan that uses manifest + local data fragments. Feature-flagged. |
| 15 | Data Integration & Quality Assurance | 4.5 | Extended provenance, added validation reports, integrated QA pipeline with alerts, enhanced schema drift detection. | Full QA pipeline with schema drift detection, automated alerts, reproducible validation reports; expand provenance depth remain. | Gemini can summarize QA findings in plain language, triage data issues, recommend remediation steps, and generate SQL queries for fixes. | Endpoint /api/llm/data-quality (implemented) — ingest data quality logs, produce prioritized QA report. |
| 14 | Energy Transition Progress Tracker | 4.5 | Added KPI computations (total_mwh, top_source, renewable_share), scheduled archival (weekly on Monday 9 AM), extended RAG provenance with additional sources. | KPI-level dashboards and deeper RAG provenance, plus scheduling and archival of reports remain. | Gemini can create periodic narrative progress reports, identify misalignment with targets and propose policy changes. | Endpoint /api/llm/transition-report (implemented). Automate weekly reports with RAG & template prompts. |
