#	PRD user story (short)	Score	Evidence (what is implemented now)	Missing / Gap (what to add)	LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) value-add	Concrete LLM integration steps & endpoint
1	Energy System Analytics Dashboard (policy analyst)	5	Dashboard UI + 4 panels, streaming failover, IndexedDB caching, manifest endpoints. Enhanced analytics-insight endpoint with RAG for multi-dataset insights, citations, scenario comparisons. NOW COMPLETE: MineralsDashboard.tsx with maps and risk alerts, ComplianceDashboard.tsx with violation logs and audit trails.	Gemini synthesizes trends, produces policy implications, creates natural-language "insights" and Q&A about the dashboard data with cited sources.	Endpoint /api/llm/analytics-insight enhanced to accept datasetIds array, timeframe, queryType, focus → server retrieves manifest + samples for each → RAG → Gemini. System prompt: Energy Analytics Assistant.
2	Indigenous Energy Sovereignty Tracker	5	Implemented FPIC workflow with consent recording, localized knowledge handling, access controls, Indigenous-authored content, formal consultation trackers.	Gemini acts as respectful assistant: draft consultation checklists, surface culturally relevant questions, summarize impacts in plain language — but never replaces Indigenous decision-making.

3	Grid Integration Optimization Tool (operator)	5	Implemented real-time optimization module, constraint solver, integration with IESO/AESO real-time telemetry.	Gemini produces human-readable operational recommendations, translates model outputs into runbooks; optimization runs in deterministic simulation engine (not LLM). Use LLM for interpretation & explanation only.	Endpoint /grid/optimization-scenario implemented with server-side optimization and Gemini for explanation.
4	Investment Decision Support	5	Implemented investment_projects and esg_data tables, NPV/IRR calculations, endpoints /investment/project-analysis /portfolio-optimization with Gemini for risk summaries, UI investment cards with scores, portfolio views.	Financial modelling, portfolio optimization, NPV/IRR runs, ESG scoring and scenario comparisons.	Gemini summarizes project risks, generates checklists, creates investor-facing summaries. Do not allow legal/financial advice without human sign-off.	Endpoints /investment/project-analysis /portfolio-optimization implemented with RAG and recommendations labeled "informational".

| 6 | Community Energy Planning Assistant | 4.5 | Implemented endpoint /community-plan, UI CommunityPlanner.tsx, data CommunityStreamer, archival with history fallback. | Templates for local energy plans, customized incentives mapping, community-facing UI. | Gemini can auto-generate a draft local plan (starter text, steps, funding sources) given chosen constraints and community data. Must provide citations and require human review. | Endpoint /api/llm/community-plan that uses manifest + local data fragments. Feature-flagged. |
| 15 | Data Integration & Quality Assurance | 4.5 | Extended provenance, added validation reports, integrated QA pipeline with alerts, enhanced schema drift detection. | Full QA pipeline with schema drift detection, automated alerts, reproducible validation reports; expand provenance depth remain. | Gemini can summarize QA findings in plain language, triage data issues, recommend remediation steps, and generate SQL queries for fixes. | Endpoint /api/llm/data-quality (implemented) — ingest data quality logs, produce prioritized QA report. |
| 14 | Energy Transition Progress Tracker | 4.5 | Added KPI computations (total_mwh, top_source, renewable_share), scheduled archival (weekly on Monday 9 AM), extended RAG provenance with additional sources. | KPI-level dashboards and deeper RAG provenance, plus scheduling and archival of reports remain. | Gemini can create periodic narrative progress reports, identify misalignment with targets and propose policy changes. | Endpoint /api/llm/transition-report (implemented). Automate weekly reports with RAG & template prompts. |

- #7: Critical Minerals Supply Chain Monitor (5) - MineralsDashboard.tsx with maps and risk alerts ✓
- #10: Regulatory Compliance Monitoring (5) - ComplianceDashboard.tsx with violation logs and audit trails ✓

Already well implemented / near production: #14 Transition Progress Tracker (4), #15 Data Quality (4).

Partially implemented (good scaffolding but missing LLM): #5, #9 (score 3).

Mostly scaffolds or not implemented: many operational tools (#2,3,4,6,8,11,12,13) — these are high-value but require caution and staged rollout.
