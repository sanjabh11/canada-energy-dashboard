Executive Summary

The Canada Energy Intelligence Platform (CEIP) will unify federal, provincial, and Indigenous energy data into one integrated analytics and decision-support system. Using advanced AI and streaming data techniques, CEIP transforms complex, multi-source energy data into actionable insights. The platform emphasizes pattern-recognition intelligence – applying mathematical symmetry and data-driven analysis rather than abstract metaphors – to find optimization opportunities across jurisdictions and sectors.

Product Vision

Empower Canadian energy stakeholders with a single, collaborative platform that delivers timely, context-aware energy insights. CEIP will respect Indigenous data sovereignty and jurisdictional boundaries while enabling evidence-based policy making, operational optimization, and innovation across the energy sector.

Core Design Principles

Data Sovereignty and Ethics: Adhere to Indigenous data governance (FNIGC principles) and privacy laws (PIPEDA) for all Indigenous and personal data. Enforce user consent and jurisdictional rules in data access.

Simplicity & Maintainability: Use lightweight, serverless/microservices architecture (e.g. managed REST APIs, FaaS, cloud streaming services) to reduce code complexity and ease updates
fedtechmagazine.com
. Prefer open standards and incremental design (Government digital standards)
canada.ca
.

Interoperability & Standards: Design APIs as RESTful services with JSON payloads, following GC API standards
canada.ca
. Document with OpenAPI. Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1) and secure data exchange (OAuth2, API keys in headers)
canada.ca
.

Multi-Stakeholder Value: Deliver clear benefits to each user group (federal, provincial, Indigenous, industry, community). Provide transparent assumptions and a customizable interface. Support collaborative workflows (shared dashboards, comment threads).

Analytics First: Embed advanced AI analysis (using GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro) at each layer. The AI should summarize data trends, forecast scenarios, and offer recommendations, but all outputs remain explainable and reviewable by human experts.

Quick diagnosis (one-sentence)

Those 404 errors almost always mean the REST endpoints (tables) your front-end is calling do not exist in the public schema of the Supabase project (or the API path/keys/RLS are wrong). We need a short, surgical plan to verify and fix: confirm the tables exist with exactly the same names/columns the front end expects, ensure API keys/RLS/CORS are correct, then re-test with curl and the Supabase client.

Below is a careful, step-by-step plan (ordered, actionable) plus the exact SQL, test commands and sample client code you can run immediately. Follow this sequence and you’ll find and fix the root cause quickly.

Step-by-step remediation plan (do these in order)
Step 1 — Immediate quick-check (Supabase dashboard)

Open your Supabase project dashboard (you already gave the link).

Go to Table Editor → public and verify whether these tables exist (exact names):

provincial_generation

ontario_hourly_demand

alberta_supply_demand

weather_data

If any are missing, proceed to Step 2 to create them. If they exist, skip to Step 4.

Why: REST /rest/v1/<table> returns 404 when the table does not exist in public schema.

Step 2 — Create missing tables (run these SQLs in Supabase SQL editor)

Run these exact SQL statements (they create the tables with the exact column names your front-end log showed). You can paste them into Supabase SQL editor or run via supabase db query.

-- 1) Ontatio hourly demand (front-end queries order=hour.desc)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ontario_hourly_demand (
  hour timestamptz PRIMARY KEY,
  market_demand_mw double precision,
  ontario_demand_mw double precision,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- 2) Provincial generation (front-end expects date column)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS provincial_generation (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  date date,
  province_code text,
  source text,
  generation_gwh double precision,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- 3) Alberta supply/demand (front-end ordered by timestamp)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS alberta_supply_demand (
  timestamp timestamptz PRIMARY KEY,
  total_gen_mw double precision,
  total_demand_mw double precision,
  pool_price_cad double precision,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- 4) Weather data (front-end queries weather_data)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS weather_data (
  timestamp timestamptz PRIMARY KEY,
  station_id text,
  temperature_c double precision,
  wind_speed_m_s double precision,
  precipitation_mm double precision,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Optional: source_health (monitoring table)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS source_health (
  source_name text PRIMARY KEY,
  last_success timestamptz,
  last_failure timestamptz,
  consecutive_failures int DEFAULT 0,
  notes text
);


Notes:

gen_random_uuid() requires pgcrypto/pgext; if not available, replace with uuid_generate_v4() or serial id.

Use the SQL Editor in Supabase dashboard to run these directly.

Step 3 — Confirm REST access / RLS / policies

Go to Authentication → Policies → Row Level Security for each table.

If RLS is ENABLED, ensure there is a policy that allows SELECT for the frontend role (anon/public). Example policy you can create for each table:

-- Enable row-level security (if not enabled)
ALTER TABLE ontario_hourly_demand ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow anonymous (public) selects (create one policy per table)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anon select" ON ontario_hourly_demand
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'anon');


If you prefer quicker: temporarily disable RLS on these tables to test:

ALTER TABLE ontario_hourly_demand DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE provincial_generation DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE alberta_supply_demand DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE weather_data DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;


After verifying everything works, re-enable RLS and create least-privilege policies.

Step 4 — Test the REST endpoints with curl (exact commands)

Run these from your terminal (replace the SUPABASE_ANON_KEY value with the anon key from your Supabase project Settings → API):

# set env var for convenience
export SUPA_URL="https://qnymbecjgeaoxsfphrti.supabase.co"
export SUPA_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"

# Ontatio hourly demand
curl -i -H "apikey: $SUPA_KEY" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPA_KEY" \
  "$SUPA_URL/rest/v1/ontario_hourly_demand?select=*&order=hour.desc&limit=2"

# Provincial generation
curl -i -H "apikey: $SUPA_KEY" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPA_KEY" \
  "$SUPA_URL/rest/v1/provincial_generation?select=*&order=date.desc&limit=20"

# Alberta supply/demand
curl -i -H "apikey: $SUPA_KEY" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPA_KEY" \
  "$SUPA_URL/rest/v1/alberta_supply_demand?select=*&order=timestamp.desc&limit=2"

# Weather data
curl -i -H "apikey: $SUPA_KEY" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPA_KEY" \
  "$SUPA_URL/rest/v1/weather_data?select=*&order=timestamp.desc&limit=5"


Expected:

HTTP 200 + JSON array (or empty []) if tables exist and policy allows SELECT.

HTTP 404 means the table does not exist (or wrong project ref / path).

HTTP 401/403 means auth/key/RLS issue.

Step 5 — Confirm front-end environment variables and base URL

Verify the front-end Netlify environment variables / build-time variables include:

VITE_SUPABASE_URL = https://qnymbecjgeaoxsfphrti.supabase.co

VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = <anon key>
(If you use a different naming convention, confirm the code uses the same env names.)

Ensure the client uses these env vars at runtime (with Vite they must start with VITE_).

Sample front-end supabase client (React/Vite):

// src/lib/supabaseClient.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const SUPA_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const SUPA_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

export const supabase = createClient(SUPA_URL, SUPA_KEY);


And sample query:

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('ontario_hourly_demand')
  .select('*')
  .order('hour', { ascending: false })
  .limit(2);


If your front-end used raw fetch() to .../rest/v1/... directly from the browser, ensure you include the apikey & Authorization headers and that CORS is allowed by Supabase (Supabase handles this for its REST endpoints).

Step 6 — Re-test the site

Reload the website and open console/network. If the 404 errors are gone and calls return 200, the dashboard should populate.

If you still see errors, copy one failing URL and run the curl command above to inspect the HTTP headers and body (Supabase often includes helpful JSON error messages).

Step 7 — Fix the favicon and other 404s

favicon.ico 404 is harmless but fixable: place a favicon.ico in your public/ folder in the build and redeploy. Netlify serves from public/ by default.

Step 8 — Harden after testing

After everything is green:

Re-enable RLS and write proper policies for the exact operations needed (SELECT for anon on read-only tables; insert/upsert only via server functions with service role key).

Replace SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE usage on server functions; never expose the service role to client code.

Add the source_health table and update ingestion jobs to write last_success/last_failure so the UI can show ingestion health.

Add logging/alerts for repeated ingestion failures (3+ consecutive → Slack/email/webhook).

Why this will fix it (summary)

404 from Supabase REST is most commonly table-not-found. Creating the tables with the exact names resolves that immediately.

Next-most-common causes are private tables (RLS without policy) or wrong keys/envvars — the curl tests will reveal which it is (401/403 vs 404).

Extra diagnostics (if the above still fails)

If curl returns 404 even after ensuring tables exist:

Verify you're hitting the same project (check Supabase project reference in Settings → Project URL).

Re-run SELECT tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE schemaname='public'; in the SQL editor to list public tables and verify the table name spelling.

Confirm no schema other than public is being used (REST uses public by default). If you used a different schema, either move the table to public or call the REST with /?schema=<schema> (not recommended).
=======
CEIP — SQL Migration, Supabase Edge Test Function, React Dashboard Stub

This document contains three deliverables in copy-paste-ready form:

SQL migration to create the missing tables and helper extension.

Supabase Edge Function (Node) fetch-ieso — a safe, idempotent test function that fetches the IESO CSV and UPSERTs new rows into ontario_hourly_demand.

React Dashboard stub (DashboardStub.jsx) — Vite/React component demonstrating reading the Supabase REST/JS client, showing latest Ontario demand and a small realtime subscription.

1) SQL Migration (paste into Supabase SQL editor)
-- CEIP initial migrations: create extensions and core tables
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor (Project -> SQL Editor -> New Query)


-- Enable uuid and pgcrypto or extension used to generate UUIDs (choose based on Postgres config)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";


-- 1) Ontatio hourly demand (front-end queries order=hour.desc)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ontario_hourly_demand (
  hour timestamptz PRIMARY KEY,
  market_demand_mw double precision,
  ontario_demand_mw double precision,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);


-- 2) Provincial generation (front-end expects date column)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS provincial_generation (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  date date,
  province_code text,
  source text,
  generation_gwh double precision,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_prov_date ON provincial_generation (province_code, date);


-- 3) Alberta supply/demand (front-end ordered by timestamp)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS alberta_supply_demand (
  timestamp timestamptz PRIMARY KEY,
  total_gen_mw double precision,
  total_demand_mw double precision,
  pool_price_cad double precision,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);


-- 4) Weather data (front-end queries weather_data)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS weather_data (
  timestamp timestamptz PRIMARY KEY,
  station_id text,
  temperature_c double precision,
  wind_speed_m_s double precision,
  precipitation_mm double precision,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);


-- 5) Optional monitoring table for ETL health
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS source_health (
  source_name text PRIMARY KEY,
  last_success timestamptz,
  last_failure timestamptz,
  consecutive_failures int DEFAULT 0,
  notes text
);


-- Quick RLS helper (optional): disable RLS while debugging. Re-enable and create policies after validation.
-- ALTER TABLE ontario_hourly_demand DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE provincial_generation DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE alberta_supply_demand DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE weather_data DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
2) Supabase Edge Function — fetch-ieso (Node)

Purpose: sample ingestion function to fetch IESO CSV (public feed), parse it, and UPSERT only new rows into ontario_hourly_demand.

Notes before using:

Save this as a Supabase Edge function (or Netlify function) file: functions/fetch-ieso/index.js.

Set environment variables in your Supabase project (Project Settings → Environment variables) or Netlify env:

SUPABASE_URL — e.g. https://qnymbecjgeaoxsfphrti.supabase.co

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE — your Supabase service role key (server-only)

IESO_CSV_URL — (optional override) defaults to https://reports-public.ieso.ca/public/Demand/PUB_Demand.csv

Implementation (copy/paste):

// functions/fetch-ieso/index.js
    }


    const lastTs = lastRow && lastRow.length ? new Date(lastRow[0].hour) : new Date(0);


    const toUpsert = [];
    for (const rrow of rows) {
      // Typical IESO CSV has Date and Hour columns; adapt if format differs
      // Example CSV columns: "Date","Hour","Market Demand","Ontario Demand"
      const dateStr = rrow['Date'] || rrow['date'] || rrow['DATE'];
      const hourStr = rrow['Hour'] || rrow['hour'] || rrow['HOUR'];
      if (!dateStr || !hourStr) continue;


      // Normalize to ISO timestamptz; assume local timezone info may be absent
      // Build: YYYY-MM-DD and hour number (0-23); adjust timezone as needed for display
      const hourNum = String(hourStr).padStart(2, '0');
      // Some CSVs provide hour as 1..24; convert 24 to 00 next day
      let H = parseInt(hourNum, 10);
      let dateISO = dateStr;


      if (H === 24) {
        // increment date by 1 day and set hour 00
        const d = new Date(dateStr + 'T00:00:00');
        d.setUTCDate(d.getUTCDate() + 1);
        dateISO = d.toISOString().slice(0,10);
        H = 0;
      }


      const ts = new Date(`${dateISO}T${String(H).padStart(2,'0')}:00:00Z`).toISOString();


      if (new Date(ts) <= lastTs) continue; // skip old rows


      const marketDemand = parseFloat(rrow['Market Demand'] ?? rrow['Market'] ?? rrow['MARKET DEMAND'] ?? rrow['Market Demand (MW)'] || '0') || 0;
      const ontDemand = parseFloat(rrow['Ontario Demand'] ?? rrow['Ontario'] ?? rrow['ONTARIO DEMAND'] || '0') || 0;


      toUpsert.push({ hour: ts, market_demand_mw: marketDemand, ontario_demand_mw: ontDemand });
    }


    if (toUpsert.length === 0) {
      return res.status(200).json({ inserted: 0 });
    }


    const { error: upsertErr } = await supabase
      .from('ontario_hourly_demand')
      .upsert(toUpsert, { onConflict: 'hour' });


    if (upsertErr) {
      console.error('Upsert error', upsertErr);
      return res.status(500).json({ error: upsertErr.message });
    }


    // Update source health table
    await supabase.from('source_health').upsert({ source_name: 'ieso_csv', last_success: new Date().toISOString(), consecutive_failures: 0 }, { onConflict: 'source_name' });


    return res.status(200).json({ inserted: toUpsert.length });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('fetch-ieso exception', err.message || err);
    // bump failure count
    try {
      await supabase.rpc('increment_failure', { src_name: 'ieso_csv' });
    } catch (e) { /* no-op */ }
    return res.status(500).json({ error: err.message || 'unknown' });
  }
}

Deployment & Scheduling

Deploy as a Supabase Edge Function or Netlify scheduled function. Use Supabase Scheduled Functions or an external cron to invoke every 1–5 minutes.

Make sure the function runs with SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE (never expose this to client code).

3) React Dashboard Stub (Vite + React + Supabase JS)

File path suggestion: src/components/DashboardStub.jsx

Purpose: simple component that:

queries latest 2 rows of ontario_hourly_demand

queries latest 20 rows of provincial_generation

subscribes to realtime changes for ontario_hourly_demand

Copy/paste code:

// src/components/DashboardStub.jsx
  const [provincial, setProvincial] = useState([]);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);


  useEffect(() => {
    let sub = null;


    async function load() {
      try {
        const { data: ontData, error: ontErr } = await supabase
          .from('ontario_hourly_demand')
          .select('*')
          .order('hour', { ascending: false })
          .limit(2);
        if (ontErr) throw ontErr;
        setOntario(ontData || []);


        const { data: provData, error: provErr } = await supabase
          .from('provincial_generation')
          .select('*')
          .order('date', { ascending: false })
          .limit(20);
        if (provErr) throw provErr;
        setProvincial(provData || []);


        // Realtime subscription (Postgres changes via Realtime)
        sub = supabase
          .channel('public:ontario_hourly_demand')
          .on('postgres_changes', { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'ontario_hourly_demand' }, (payload) => {
            console.log('Realtime insert payload', payload);
            // Prepend new row to state
            setOntario(prev => [payload.new, ...prev].slice(0, 10));
          })
          .subscribe();


      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Dashboard load error', err);
        setError(err.message || 'Unknown error');
      }
    }


    load();


    return () => {
      if (sub) supabase.removeChannel(sub);
    };
  }, []);


  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">CEIP — Dashboard (Stub)</h2>
      {error && <div className="text-red-600">Error: {error}</div>}


      <section className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="font-medium">Latest Ontario Demand</h3>
        {ontario.length === 0 ? (
          <p>No data yet — ensure the `ontario_hourly_demand` table exists and your ingestion job ran.</p>
        ) : (
          <table className="w-full table-auto border-collapse">
            <thead>
              <tr><th>Hour</th><th>Market (MW)</th><th>Ontario (MW)</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              {ontario.map(row => (
                <tr key={row.hour}>
                  <td>{new Date(row.hour).toLocaleString()}</td>
                  <td>{row.market_demand_mw ?? '-'}</td>
                  <td>{row.ontari

I've created the code artifacts in the canvas titled "CEIP - SQL Migration, Edge Test Function, React Stub" (visible in the document pane).

Next steps I recommend:

Run the SQL in Supabase SQL Editor exactly as provided.

Deploy the Edge function (fetch-ieso) to Supabase Edge Functions and set the required env vars (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE, optional IESO_CSV_URL).

Add the React stub to your frontend and ensure Vite env vars (VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) are set in Netlify.
